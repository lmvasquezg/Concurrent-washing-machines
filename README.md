# Concurrent washing machines

You have two washing machines powered by the same source. Each washer has a capacity
Up to 100 kilograms But, since both washing machines are powered by the same current,
they can only work at the same time when both are loaded with half of their
maximum capacity (50 kilograms) or with some propocional measure: the first washing machine with
40 kilograms, the second with 60 kilograms. If the values ​​exceed 100 kilograms,
Only one of them can work simultaneously.

This is an example of the use of semaphores and monitors for process synchronization.
